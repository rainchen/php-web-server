======

This is a very simple PHP (2 script) webserver, created using the original code from Benjamin Maynor.

To run this server, clone the repository (or fork if you want to modify), by running

> git clone git://github.com/busbyjon/php-web-server.git

Then start the server by running

> php server.php /path/to/webroot port

There are _some_ custom rewrite rules for symfony which may require modification, but the server should run.

** You must have the php-cgi binary in your path for this to work **
